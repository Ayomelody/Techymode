Files in this zip are ready to drop into a GitHub repository root. To publish via GitHub Pages:

1. Create a new GitHub repo (public).
2. Upload all files and directories from this zip to the repo root (index.html must be at root).
3. In the repo settings -> Pages, set the source to `main` branch (or `gh-pages`) and root.
4. Wait a minute and visit `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/index.html`

Notes:
- The contact form is not processed on GitHub Pages. Use the mailto link provided or wire up a form service (Formspark, Netlify Forms, etc.).
- Edit the content in the HTML files directly or migrate to a static site generator later.
